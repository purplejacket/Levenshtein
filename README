This git repository was inspired by the following problem I solved:

Two words are friends if they have a Levenshtein distance of 1. That is, you can add, remove, or substitute exactly one letter in word X to create word Y. A wordâ€™s social network  consists of all of its friends, plus all of their friends, and all of their friends' friends, and so on. I want a program to tell us how big the social network for the word "causes" is, using this word list.

This is the wikipedia entry on Levenshtein distance: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance
This is the word list: https://github.com/causes/puzzles/raw/master/word_friends/word.list

BK-Trees can be used to find near matches to words based on Levenshtein distance:
